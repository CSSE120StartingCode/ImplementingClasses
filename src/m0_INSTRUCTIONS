Students:

Here is how you do today's exercise, in m1_Point.

TODO 2.  It tells you to:
  -- With your instructor, understand these instructions.

Then, for each TODO 3 to the end of the exercise, you will do the following:
   -- Read the specification of the method.
   -- Examine the EXAMPLE code in the doc-string for that method.
   -- Copy-and-paste the EXAMPLE code into the TEST function
      -- Use the Tab and Shift-Tab keystrokes as needed to fix the indentation of the pasted code.
      -- Yes, the run_test_ functions are empty until you copy-and-paste in the test code.
   -- Implement and test the method.

We may code the first few TODOs together.
